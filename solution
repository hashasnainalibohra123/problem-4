			When a empoyee joint the rank is initialized to 1
						and history arryList is null
						
			when a employee got promoted :-
				1. Increase the current rank
				2. get the history of the employee
					if it is null 
						then create new entry in the history array;
					else
						add one more entry in history array with the current desigantion.
	retriving part :- 
	
		we can Use the sorted History array associated with the each employee;
		based on the input ex:- last 2 we get the first two entries from the Sorted HashMaap.
